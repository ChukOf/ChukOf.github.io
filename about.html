        <p>My name is Chukwujika Ofordu, but you can call me "Chuk" if that's too hard,  and I am an aspiring software engineer. I've always had a love for technology, game development, and figuring out how things work. On my website, you will see my progress of learning and understanding different languages in my projects. Some are exercises from my classes and some are my own personal projects. You can also see more of my work by visiting my <a href="https://github.com/ChukOf">GitHub</a>.</p>
        <p>Aside from technology I also have interests in the art of puppetry, reading lots of fiction and non-fiction books, writing stories, drawing, listening to all different types of music, and of course, video games! I do hope to find a way to incorporate all my other interests with technology in someway!</p>
