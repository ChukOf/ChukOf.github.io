        <p>This is the homepage of my website, but feel free to look around! You can explore all three pages, two if you include my Projects Page and my About Me/Contact page!!</p>
        <p>Hope you caught my sense of sarcasm and comedy in that last paragraph ;). But in all serious, I hope that this website will improve over time, as will I, and be a showcase as to what I can do and what I'm eager to learn!</p>
